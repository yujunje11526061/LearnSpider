'''
url去重
DeltaFetch is a spider middleware to ignore requests to pages containing items
seen in previous crawls of the same spider, thus producing a "delta crawl"
containing only new items.

This also speeds up the crawl, by reducing the number of requests that need
to be crawled, and processed (typically, item requests are the most cpu
intensive).
